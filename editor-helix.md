# Using serve-d with [Helix][1]
---

Support for D including serve-d is included in Helix as of release 22.12, so
then you should be good to go, as long as serve-d is on your path.)

This makes use of a [Tree-sitter grammar for D][2] so syntax highlighting and
related functionality is very fast, and of serve-d for other advanced capabilities.

At the moment configuration options are limited.
